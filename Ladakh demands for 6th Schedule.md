# Ladakh demands to be a Part of 6th Schedule

## What is the 6th Schedule

- The 6th Schedule of the Indian Constitution protects tribal populations and provides autonomy to the communities through creation of autonomous development councils that can frame laws on land, public health, agriculture and others.
- It is mentioned under Article 244
- Currently there are 4 states in the 6th Schedule
    1. Assam
    2. Meghalaya
    3. Tripura
    4. Mizoram
- It is a part of Tribal affairs
- The current minister of Tribal affairs is Arjun Munda
- When such powers have to be given in a non-tribal area they are included in the 5th Schedule
- **List of autonomous district councils**
    - Garo, Khasi and Jaintia ADC (Meghalaya)
    - Chakma, Lai and Mara ADC
    - Tripura Tribal ADC
    - Dima Hasao, Bodoland, Karbi Anglong ADC


## The Merit of Such a Demand

- 90% of the entire population is tribal
- And the majority of the population is part of the Schedule Tribes
- They claim that it would also help with improving and inculcating values of democracy with the people of Ladakh
- The 6th schedule has never been given to a UT

## Ladakh UT

- Ladakh UT was formed under the JK Reorganisation Act 2019
- Ladakh has 2 districts
    1. Leh
    2. Kargil
- The governer of Ladakh is Radha Krishna Mathur
- The MP is Jamgyal Tsering Namgyal
